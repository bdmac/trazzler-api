Try a flight to sample three wines on their list, such as the soft, elegant Expression 44 Pinot Noir or the T-Vine 2006 Petite Sirah. Order a half-glass of a sparking rose, or a glass or bottle of one of their Zinfandels. Refreshing recommendations on a sunny day, particularly if you're out on the patio:  the Steigl, a lemon-y beer concoction from Salzburg, and the Duchy Originals Organic English Ale from Oxfordshire. The best thing about Wellington's?
